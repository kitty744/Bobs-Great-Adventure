The save.dat file stores saved data
Btw it changes everytime you save the game
This is actually my saved file so if you wanna run the project make sure you delete the save.dat
It will create a new one by it's self once you save the game

The config.txt file stores info for the fullscreen, music bar, and sound effect bar
